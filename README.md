# odin_recipes
The recipes project from the odin project!(https://www.theodinproject.com/)

I found the initial assignment quite simple, given this is what my class had covered, so I am jazzing it up with some css and buttons to challenge myself and make something super presentable. The buttons were super fun and my first time experementing with different button options.

I may come back and make some more edits and changes in the future, but for now I am happy with it!

-Currently adding back buttons to navigate to the home page better.
