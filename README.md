# Simple Protein Shake Recipie Site
The recipes project from the odin project!(https://www.theodinproject.com/)

There is a preview available here: https://jamiemetcalfe18.github.io/odin_recipes/

## Purpose Of This Project
I found the initial assignment quite simple, given this is what my class had covered, so I am jazzing it up with some css and buttons to challenge myself and make something super presentable. The buttons were super fun and my first time experementing with different button options.

I may come back and make some more edits and changes in the future, but for now I am happy with it!

## What I Learned
-How to link to pages and images from a page inside a folder.
-Buttons and their different options.
-Resizing images
