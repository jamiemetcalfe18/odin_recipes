Challenging myself!

There is a preview available here: https://jamiemetcalfe18.github.io/protein_shake_recipies/

## Purpose Of This Project
I am testing my skills with html and css after my course to stay sharp. I am jazzing it up with some css and buttons to challenge myself and make something super presentable. The buttons were super fun and my first time experementing with different button options.

I may come back and make some more edits and changes in the future, but for now I am happy with it!

## What I Learned

-How to link to pages and images from a page inside a folder.

-Buttons and their different options.

-Resizing images
